  -Part 2: Turtlebot burger Obstacle Avoidance
  -Part 3: Turtlebot burger Real-World Implementation of Obstacle Avoidance

##Part 1: Wall Following
Run the task1.launch file in the launch folder using the following command:
`roslaunch assignment_5 task1.launch`
This opens the wall_following world and then runs the Part_1.py script located in the src folder.
