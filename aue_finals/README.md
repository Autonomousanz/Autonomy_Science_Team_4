# Assignment 5

### Git clone the repository :

`git clone https://github.com/dkoundinya/Autonomy_Science_Team_4.git `


The Objective of the Capstone project can be summarized in following 4 parts:

  - Part 1: Turtlebot burger Wall Following and Obstacle Avoidance
  - Part 2: Turtlebot burger Line Following 
  - Part 3: Turtlebot burger Stop sign Detection
  - Part 4: Turtlebot burger April tag Detection


Turtlebot burger Sim to Real-World Implementation of all above tasks

## Real-world:


Run the final.launch file in the launch folder using the following command:

`roslaunch aue_finals final.launch`

This file brings up following launch files 
raspberry camera node, 
turtlebot bringup, 
darknet ros launch for stop sign detection 
continuous detection launch for april tag detection

It simultaneously runs the final code python script that is programmed as follows:

The turtlebot is equipped with two sensors LDS LiDAR and Raspberry Pi Camera that are continuosly used for performing all the tasks

a. The obstacle Avoidance on the turtlebot was designed using PID controller wherein the bot always checks for obstacles in front, left and right using the ranges obtained from LDS LiDAR.

b. The Camera detects the line using Mask generated by the HSV filtering technique with the aid of Open CV -ROS package bridge. A PID controller is used for following the line of the turtlebot

c. The April-tag ros package is used for detection of April tag  and then PID is designed for following the yellow line on the track

d. While following the line Darknet-ros package is used for detection of STOP sign and pausing itself for few minutes.

## Simulation:

Requirements : Before running the simulation, the following files must be present and placed in the correct folders:

1. World and model files of the environment if in aue_finals folder, run following commands :

'export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=/path/to/workspace/src/aue_finals/models:/path/to/workspace/src/turtlebot3_simulations/turtlebot3_gazebo/models'

2. Run the launch file to run all the tasks as described above :

'roslaunch aue_finals turtlebot3_autonomy_final.launch' 


Videos of simulations  implementation  are located in the videos folder
