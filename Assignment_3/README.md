#Move the Turtlebot3 in a 3D Simulation environment offered by Gazebo:
run roslaunch assignment_3 part1.launch to make turtlebot move in gazebo environment : 
use code:=circle at end of roslaunch command for moving turtlebot in circle of radius 1 unit and 0.5 linear speed
use code:=square at end of roslaunch command for moving turtlebot in square 
run roslaunch assignment_3 part2.launch to implement emergency braking
